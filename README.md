Instagram Clone Project

This project is a simple clone of the Instagram page, built for understanding its structure and layout. The clone includes two versions:

Insta3.html is a cloned page which using only html, css

Bootstap.html is a html page which replaces the css from the Insta3.html and coverts to in-line bootstrap styling 

The primary goal of this project is to explore the differences between using plain CSS and Bootstrap for building similar layouts, and to understand the flexibility and constraints of each approach.
Also added the div structure visualization for better understanding
